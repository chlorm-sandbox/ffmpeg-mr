README - Building
-----

To use build.sh, you need to use the 'useful-commands.sh' to make a build.tar (for 32 bit),
and a build64.tar (for 64 bit) and place them in this directory. They are used a the base
for the automatic builds and contain all the sources and object code for the dependencies.

Pre-built versions are provided in the lib and lib64 directories.
