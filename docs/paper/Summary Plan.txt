Introduce your project (Keynote Slides = 7 mins)
--------------------------------------------------
Keynote presentation.
	- Background
	- Research Question
	- Deliverables
	- Analysis
	- (lead into Demo)
	- Cloud Architecture (whilst running demo)
	- MapReduce Conceptual Overview (whilst running demo)

Demonstrate your implementation. Answer the examiners’ questions (13 mins).
--------------------------------------------------
Demo of a single machine vs. 19 machines in the cloud.

1. Start single machine processing, using FFmpeg reference.
2. Start MR processing.
3. Briefly go through the Transcode Job def file, and show what we are about to launch/transcode.
4. Point out on the Cloud Diagram where the data is, and briefly what is about to happen.
5. Walkthorugh the Cloud diagram to explain what is happening.
6. Walkthorugh the MR diagram to show what is happening conceptually.
7. Bring up the GUI.
8. Let the examiners play with the monitoring application, and see the job progressing.


Q&A (10 mins)
----
	Why did you choose MapReduce?
	Why didn’t you choose just build something using MPI/Custom Java/etc?
	What was the most useful thing you read?
	How did you evaluate the performance/quality?
	What was the most difficult or most interesting part of the work?
	What would you do differently in a second attempt? 
	How would you extend the project if you had more time?
	Why is this of interest to the research community in the area of Parallel Video Transcoding?
	Why is your project of wider interest?
